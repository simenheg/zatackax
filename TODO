(see http://code.google.com/p/zatackax/issues/ for status)

Stuff that needs to be done:
 *  make sound effects for every weapon! The current sound effects are only
    temporary.
 *  let player pick choosable weapons before a game.
 *  let player customize the charges of each weapon before a game.
 *  make a cool winning screen.
 *  record match statistics.
 *  add a narrator!
 *  more customizable zatas (speed, turning angle, thickness)

Stuff that would be cool to have (wishlist):
 *  special broadcast messages, e.g. when a player wins 5 matches in a row.
 *  make the code more modular for better maintainability.
